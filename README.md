# Home Loan Approval Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the eligibility of a loan applicant for a home loan. By analyzing various factors such as income, credit history, education, and family status, the model classifies applications as either "Approved" or "Rejected".

This project demonstrates a complete Data Science workflow, including:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing** to handle missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering** to create meaningful predictors.
- **Model Building** using classification algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation** to assess performance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about loan applications, including:
- **Gender, Marital Status, Dependents**: Demographic information.
- **Education, Self_Employed**: Applicant's background.
- **ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome**: Financial status.
- **LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term**: Loan details.
- **Credit_History**: Past credit behavior (Key predictor).
- **Property_Area**: Urban, Semiurban, or Rural.
- **Loan_Status**: Target variable (Y/N).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine Learning modeling and evaluation.

## Key Insights (To be updated)
- Credit History is a strong indicator of loan approval.
